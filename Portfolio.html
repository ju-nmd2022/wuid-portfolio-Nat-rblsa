                JN2F2 is a single control unit for washbasin, constructed in common materials used in faucets such as metals or plastics. It has a transparent plastic compartment, which only stores the water necessary for a certain activity, to avoid water waste. To select the required amount of water, there is a button that changes the mode of use according to the number of times it is pressed and a screen on which the selection of the user is projected.

                With the packaging redesign proposal we want to visaully attract the consumer to achieve a first approach with curiosity and then with a physical interaction with the design of the products. The design would describe in a better way the content of the product and its benefits, but we also seek to create a packaging that the user wants to have and try.

                MAMPA is a lamp designed to have a better handling of light, since each acrylic sheet can be moved to the end of its row causing a light to turn on. Thus, the user can have the desired light intensity.
