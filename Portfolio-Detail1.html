            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;">To bring to the Latin American context the case of the Ento Project, in which proposes the replacement of animal protein intake from livestock by protein from insects, as a global feeding strategy for the coming years. Global demand for food is accelerating and the areas of agriculture and livestock cannot keep up. The current sources of protein have a huge environmental impact. The livestock industry is 70% of the agricultural land.

        <p>With the packaging redesign proposal we want to be able to visaully atract the consumer to achieve a first approach with curiosity and then with a physical interaction with the design of the products. The design would describe in a better way the content of the product and its benefits, but we also seek to create a packaging that the user wants to have and try.</p>
